Notice about current Status of the project
==========================================

Since April, I have no devices to test any patches anymore.
Because I don't think this library has many users these days, I suggest a guideline for bugs and patches.

- Any bug reports will be just archived - I don't have any way to solve it.
- Any patches doesn't look suspicious will be accepted - I will considerate real users. If there is new problems, you can go back to older version or suggest reverting.

Any volunteer - is there someone, really? -  who want to take over this project also will be appreciated.
We will watch the project together for a while and I will grant every permission.

I will review all the reports weather your issue includes this information or not. But I prefer easy issues and these informations make me feel easy to review the issue. (So, of course, if your issue is obvious and clear, no additional information is required)
